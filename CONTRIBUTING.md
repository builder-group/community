### `package.json` structure

The structure of the `package.json` file in this project should adhere to a specific format, as illustrated by the example structure below. This structure is based on the [npm documentation for creating a `package.json` file](https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-a-package-json-file).

```json
{
	"name": "@blgc/template",
	"description": "Description of the package",
	"version": "0.0.1",
	"private": true, // Or false if package should be published to NPM
	"scripts": {
		"build": "shx rm -rf dist && ../../scripts/cli.sh bundle",
		"start:dev": "tsc -w",
		"lint": "eslint --ext .js,.ts src/",
		"clean": "shx rm -rf dist && shx rm -rf node_modules && shx rm -rf .turbo",
		"install:clean": "pnpm run clean && pnpm install",
		"test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
	},
	"repository": {
		"type": "git",
		"url": "https://github.com/builder-group/monorepo.git"
	},
	"keywords": [],
	"author": "@bennobuilder",
	"license": "MIT",
	"bugs": {
		"url": "https://github.com/builder-group/monorepo/issues"
	},
	"homepage": "https://builder.group/?source=github",
	"dependencies": {
		// Project dependencies here
	},
	"peerDependencies": {
		// Project peerDependencies here
	},
	"devDependencies": {
		// Project devDependencies here
	}
}
```

For specific packages, additional fields should be included as shown below. Note that the fields `source`, `main`, `module`, `types`, and `files` are usually required in packages:

```json
{
	// ..
	// "scripts": ..,
	"source": "./src/index.ts", // Entry file (source code)
	"main": "./dist/cjs/index.js", // Entry point (CommonJS)
	"module": "./dist/esm/index.js", // Entry point (ES Module)
	"types": "./dist/types/index.d.ts", // Type definitions
	// ..
	// "devDependencies": {},
	"files": [
		// List of files to be included in your package
	]
}
```

## Q and A

### Why is `@blgc/types` listed as a dependency in some packages?

`@blgc/types` is listed as a dependency to ensure it's automatically installed for consumers, preventing issues like `any` types for `feature-x` packages due to missing `TUnionToIntersection`.

For more details: [Microsoft/types-publisher/issues/81](https://github.com/Microsoft/types-publisher/issues/81).

Alternatives:
- Move `TUnionToIntersection` into each package
- Enforce `@blgc/types` as a `peerDependency`
