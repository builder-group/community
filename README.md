## ‚ùì FAQ

### What does `blgc` stand for?

`blgc` stands for **B**ui**L**der.**G**roup **C**ommunity, chosen because similar names like `blg`, `bldr` and `bgc` were already taken.

### Why a Monorepo?

Maintaining all libraries in a single repository keeps things simple and efficient. A monorepo allows for shared tooling, consistent versioning, and streamlined CI/CD workflows, while making cross-library changes easier. This approach simplifies collaboration and reduces overhead, ensuring all libraries remain in sync.

The only disadvantage is that it's harder to discover individual libraries via SEO since they're all part of one repo. However, the benefits far outweigh this limitation.

### Why two build modes (`build` vs `build:prod`)?

Development builds (`pnpm build`):

- Includes TypeScript declaration maps (IDE navigation goes directly to source files instead of compiled definitions)
- Easier debugging (no code minification and optimizations)

Production builds (`pnpm build:prod`):

- Smaller package size
- No development artifacts in published packages
- Code minification and optimizations enabled
- Prevents npm errors with declaration maps (e.g., EINVALIDTAGNAME in GitHub CLI)

To switch between modes:

- Development: `pnpm build` (includes declaration maps)
- Production: `pnpm build:prod` (excludes declaration maps)
